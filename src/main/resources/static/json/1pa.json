Here we do calculation using margins for Democratic in MA in 2016. If the absolute value of efficiency gap is greater than 8 percent, the state may be a partisian gerrymander. A positive efficiency gap value indicates that Democratic has an advantage; a negative value indicates that Democratic is disadvantaged. \nIn MA in 2016, the seat margin for Democratic was 14.3%, the vote margin for Democratic was 65.2%, and the efficiency gap is -66.05%.\nIt's important to note that when one party is dominant statewide(here is MA), the efficiency gap becomes less reliable. In that case, other tests for asymmetric advantage may be used, as described in Prof. Wang's Election Law Journal article.\n\n"

Here we do calculation using margins for Democratic in ID in 2016. If the absolute value of efficiency gap is greater than 8 percent, the state may be a partisian gerrymander. A positive efficiency gap value indicates that Democratic has an advantage; a negative value indicates that Democratic is disadvantaged. \nIn ID in 2016, the seat margin for Democratic was 0.0%, the vote margin for Democratic was 31.8%, and the efficiency gap is -13.67%.\nIt's important to note that when one party is dominant statewide(here is ID), the efficiency gap becomes less reliable. In that case, other tests for asymmetric advantage may be used, as described in Prof. Wang's Election Law Journal article.\n\n"

A positive efficiency gap value indicates that Democratic has an advantage; a negative value indicates that Democratic is disadvantaged. \nIn VT in 2016, the seat margin for Democratic was 14.3%, the vote margin for Democratic was 65.2%, and the efficiency gap is -66.06%.\nIt's important to note that when one party is dominant statewide(here is VT), the efficiency gap becomes less reliable. In that case, other tests for asymmetric advantage may be used, as described in Prof. Wang's Election Law Journal article.\n\n"
